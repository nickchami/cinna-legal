            <h4>How to post a trip</h4>
            <p>Drivers can directly post a trip on our Cinna app on the Post tab. Posting a trip includes filling out your origin, destination, date and time, and vehicle.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <h4>How to set a price for your trip</h4>
            <p>Cinna automatically calculates trip fares based on distance and average fuel cost. Drivers do not manually set fares, ensuring fairness and compliance with carpooling regulations (drivers save on costs, not profit). Drivers can lower their prices accordingly.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <h4>How to add a vehicle to your account</h4>

            <p><strong>Editing a posted trip:</strong> Drivers can edit details (departure time, stops, vehicle) until the first booking is confirmed. After that, only minor updates (e.g., pick-up location clarifications) are allowed.</p>
            <p><strong>Closing a trip to prevent more booking requests:</strong> Drivers can close a trip once they’ve reached their preferred passenger count or if plans change. Closed trips remain visible to existing passengers but no new bookings can be made.</p>

            <h4>Driver cancellation policy</h4>
            <p>If a driver cancels a ride within 10 hours of its scheduled departure, they receive one strike. Cancellations made 10 hours or more before departure incur no penalty. Accumulating three strikes in a rolling year results in account suspension pending review.</p>

          <div class="article">
            <h4>How driver payouts work</h4>
            <p>Cinna processes payouts to drivers on a weekly schedule (every Friday). Payments include all completed trips that have cleared the 48-hour refund hold period.</p>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <div class="added">
              <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>Trip completed: July 15, 2025 at 10:00 AM<br>Refund hold (48 hours): Trip becomes eligible on July 17, 2025 at 10:00 AM<br>Next Friday payout: July 18, 2025</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>What is the refund hold?</strong> To protect both drivers and passengers, Cinna enforces a 48-hour refund hold after a trip is marked complete. This allows time for cancellations, refund requests, or disputes to be resolved before funds are released.</p>
            <p><strong>When will I receive my payout?</strong> Payouts are processed every Friday. Trips clearing the 48-hour hold before Thursday 11:59 PM are included that Friday; otherwise, the following Friday.</p>
            <p><strong>How do payouts work?</strong> Payouts are sent through Stripe Connect to your linked bank account or debit card. Standard payouts take 2–5 business days depending on your bank. Instant payout (if enabled by Stripe in your region) may be available for an additional fee.</p>
            <div class="added">
              <p><strong>First Payout Example:</strong> If your first completed trip was on July 15, 2025, the eligible date is July 17, 2025. The first possible payout would then occur on Friday, July 18, 2025.</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>What to do if you haven't received a payout yet:</strong> Check if the trip was marked as complete. Verify your bank account details in Stripe. Ensure no pending disputes/refunds are holding funds. If all else checks, please email us.</p>
            <p><strong>How to set up your payout method:</strong> Connect your bank account or debit card in the Payouts section of the app (powered by Stripe). Verification may take 1–2 business days.</p>
            <p><strong>What is the GST/HST on payouts?</strong> Since Cinna is a non-commercial carpooling service, we do not issue GST/HST numbers to drivers.</p>
