## 1. About Cinna
    Cinna is a platform that connects riders with drivers and bus operators for intercity transportation. Cinna is not a transportation company and does not own, operate, or control vehicles. Instead, we facilitate cost-sharing carpools and bus bookings between independent users.

## 2. Changes to the Terms
    Cinna may modify the Service or these Terms at any time. Updates will be posted, with the effective date noted. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 3. Eligibility & Accounts
    You must be at least in the year you are turning 18 to create an account.

    Drivers must hold a valid, full, non-expired driver’s licence. Learner, new, or restricted licences are not accepted.


    Drivers must maintain valid vehicle insurance. Cinna is not liable for uncovered claims.


    Vehicle profiles must include: type, capacity, seasonal equipment (e.g., winter tires Nov–Mar), luggage space, and photos (interior + exterior).


    False declarations or expired documentation may result in account suspension.



## 4. Nature of the Service
    Carpools: Cinna enables private drivers to share vehicle costs with riders. Drivers are not licensed professional carriers and may not profit beyond cost-sharing.

    You must register for an Account via school email and keep all information accurate and current.


    You're solely responsible for your interactions with other Members; exercise common sense and due caution.


    Disputes between users must be resolved independently. Except as required by law, Cinna is not liable for such interactions.
## 6. Conduct Guidelines
    Members must:
    Comply with applicable laws and regulations, including safe & sober driving.


    Respect intellectual property, privacy rights, and not misuse the Service.


    Refrain from harassment, discriminatory behavior, or abuse.


    Not use the Service for commercial activity; all trips must be cost-sharing (no profit).

## 7. Using the Service
    All trips must be pre-agreed via the Service. Additional unofficial stops or services are prohibited.


    The Driver who posts the Trip must be the one actually driving.


    All payments must be processed via Cinna’s platform. No cash transactions.
## 8. Cancellation, No-Shows & Refunds
    Rider Cancellation (Carpool)
    Riders cancelling ≥72h before departure: full refund.


    Between 72h–24h: refund decreases exponentially.


    <24h before departure: no refund.


    Mistake policy: if cancelled within 10 minutes of purchase, full refund.


    Rider Cancellation (Bus)
    Refund curve similar to carpool, with 100% refund ≥72h, 0% refund ≤24h.


    Cancellation fee + Stripe fee deducted automatically.


    Driver Cancellation (Strike Policy)
    Cancelling <10h before departure: 1 strike.


    3 strikes in a rolling year = suspension pending review.


    Riders always receive 100% refund, including service fees.


    Driver On-Time Policy
    If a driver departs >15 minutes late, 10% is deducted from their payout for that trip.


    Funds are redirected to Cinna as a late penalty.


    No-Shows
    Passenger No-Show: if rider fails to board within a 15-minute pickup window, no refund (unless pre-agreed with driver).


    Driver No-Show: full refund to passengers + no-show review on driver’s account.


## 9. Payout Policies

    Bus Vendors: Paid out every second Friday, for tickets that have cleared the 24-hour refund window.
    Carpool Drivers: Paid out weekly (Fridays), for trips that have cleared the 48-hour post-trip buffer.
    Cinna holds payments until refund windows expire to prevent sending refunded money to drivers/vendors.

    The driver is then able to adjust accordingly if needed.
